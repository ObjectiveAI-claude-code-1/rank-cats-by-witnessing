1. Evaluate the spontaneity of each cat image by examining whether the moment feels discovered rather than arranged. Look for the visual fingerprints of real, unoptimized life: imperfect framing that suggests the photographer grabbed their phone in a hurry, natural and uncontrolled lighting from whatever source the room happened to provide, backgrounds filled with the genuine clutter of a lived-in space rather than a curated backdrop, and a cat that is clearly unaware it is being photographed — caught mid-action, mid-sleep, or mid-stare rather than posed or looking into the lens. The more an image looks like nothing was prepared, cleaned, or composed for the camera, the higher it should rank on this dimension. Spontaneity is the evidence that the world was simply going about its business and someone paid enough attention to notice.

2. Evaluate the impermanence of the moment captured in each cat image by assessing how fleeting and unrepeatable the instant appears to be. Look for evidence of split-second timing: a cat mid-leap with its body in an impossible shape, a yawn so wide the face distorts, the narrow instant between knocking something off a table and the aftermath, a first encounter with a strange object, or any expression or posture that clearly existed for only a fraction of a second before vanishing forever. An image that describes a state which could have lasted minutes or hours — a cat sitting calmly, sleeping in a normal position — ranks lower than one that captures a moment so brief the photographer either caught it or lost it entirely. The more an image carries the electricity of "I cannot believe I caught that," the higher it should rank on this dimension.

3. Evaluate the generosity of each cat image by assessing the spirit in which it appears to have been shared. Look for the feeling that the image is a gift from a stranger — a dispatch from someone's ordinary life offered not to impress or promote, but simply because the moment delighted them and they wanted others to feel that delight too. Generous images carry an absence of curation: no evidence of selecting from many takes, no polished or branded presentation, no attempt to project a lifestyle. Instead, they radiate humor, tenderness, or affectionate bewilderment — the unmistakable tone of "can you believe he sleeps like this?" or "she has been sitting in this bag for an hour." The rougher and more direct the path from moment to sharing, the more generous the image feels. The more an image reads as an act of connection rather than an act of performance, the higher it should rank on this dimension.
