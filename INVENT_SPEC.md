Rank cat pictures by the quality of witnessing — whether each image feels like a moment that was discovered and caught rather than deliberately produced. Look for the texture of accident, spontaneity, and fortunate timing: signs that someone was simply present, noticed something worth preserving, and captured it. Imperfect framing, natural lighting, the ordinary clutter of a real lived-in environment, and the palpable sense of a fleeting instant frozen in time all indicate high witnessing quality. Images that feel like small, generous acts of sharing — someone saying 'look what I was lucky enough to see' — should rank highest. Images that announce their own production through deliberate staging, controlled backdrops, professional lighting setups, careful composition, or the unmistakable air of a planned photoshoot should rank lowest. The quality of witnessing also encompasses timing — the sense that the image captures a fleeting instant that will not come again. A cat mid-yawn, a kitten experiencing something for the first time, a cat frozen in an absurd posture for a split second — these derive power from their impermanence. Focus on whether the image feels found or made, discovered or manufactured, witnessed or produced.
