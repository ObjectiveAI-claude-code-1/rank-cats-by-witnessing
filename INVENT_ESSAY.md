## On the Difference Between Finding and Making

There is a particular kind of photograph that stops you mid-scroll. Not because it is beautiful in the way a portrait in a gallery is beautiful — composed, lit, considered — but because it is beautiful in the way a moment in real life is beautiful: brief, imperfect, unrepeatable, and offered to you by someone who simply happened to be there. This is the kind of image that rank-cats-by-witnessing exists to find.

The function takes in a collection of cat images — the sprawling, ungovernable mass of them that the internet produces daily — and attempts to rank them by a single, slippery, deeply human quality: the feeling of witnessing. Not photographic skill. Not cuteness. Not production value. Witnessing. The sense that you are being shown something that actually happened, in all its messy, unplanned, unrepeatable specificity, by someone who was lucky enough to be in the room when it did.

This matters because the internet is saturated with cat imagery, and most of it falls into a recognizable pattern: a beautiful cat posed against a tasteful background, bathed in soft light, looking directly into a camera held by someone who intended from the start to produce exactly this result. These images are pleasant. They are sometimes stunning. But they do not move us the way a blurry photo of a cat caught mid-sneeze on a cluttered kitchen counter does. There is a difference between an image that says "look what I made" and one that says "look what I saw," and that difference is what this function measures.

The use-cases are broad but united by a common need. A social media feed wants to surface the posts that feel most alive and genuine. A community curator wants to distinguish the photos that spark joy and laughter from the ones that merely perform competence. A person browsing for comfort at the end of a long day wants the photos that feel like small gifts from strangers — not advertisements for a lifestyle. In every case, the goal is the same: to find the images where something real was caught, not constructed.

To do this well, the function must evaluate three core qualities. Each one captures a different dimension of what it means to witness rather than produce.

### 1. Spontaneity

The first and most fundamental quality is spontaneity — the degree to which an image feels discovered rather than arranged. This is the dimension that separates the found from the made.

A spontaneous image carries the fingerprints of real life. The framing is slightly off, because the photographer did not have time to compose — they just raised their phone and hoped for the best. The background is not a backdrop but an actual room, with its actual mess: a half-eaten bowl of cereal, a stack of mail, a shoe that has no business being on the couch but is there anyway. The lighting is whatever the room happened to provide — the flat overhead glow of a kitchen fixture, the slant of afternoon sun through blinds, the bluish wash of a television in a dark living room. Nothing has been arranged for the camera because there was no plan to take a photo until the moment demanded it.

The cat itself, in a spontaneous image, is not performing. It is not gazing meaningfully into the lens. It is doing whatever it was doing before anyone thought to look: sleeping in an implausible position, staring with unhinged intensity at something invisible, sitting in a box that is clearly too small, or wearing an expression of profound and unjustifiable dignity. The cat does not know it is being photographed, and that unknowing is legible in the image. There is no collaboration between subject and photographer, only observation.

Spontaneity, then, is the quality of an image in which nothing has been optimized. It is the visual evidence that the world was going about its business and someone was simply paying enough attention to notice.

### 2. Impermanence

The second quality is impermanence — the palpable sense that the moment captured in the image existed for only an instant and will never exist again.

This is the dimension of timing. A cat mid-leap, its body fully extended and its face wearing an expression of absolute commitment. A kitten encountering a mirror for the first time, one paw raised, head tilted, caught in the precise instant between curiosity and alarm. A cat yawning so wide that it briefly stops looking like a cat at all. A cat that has just knocked something off a table and has been frozen by the camera in the narrow window between the act and the consequence. These images derive their power not from what they show, but from the knowledge that what they show lasted less than a second. The photographer did not get to try again. They either caught it or they did not, and they caught it.

Impermanence is what gives a photograph urgency. An image of a cat sitting calmly on a windowsill is pleasant, but it describes a state that likely persisted for minutes or hours — you could have taken it at any point. An image of a cat in mid-air, legs splayed in four different directions, describes a state that lasted a fraction of a second. The first image is a description. The second is a rescue — a moment pulled from the current of time that would otherwise have disappeared without a trace.

The function must be sensitive to this quality because it is central to what witnessing means. A witness, by definition, is someone present at a specific moment. The more specific and fleeting the moment, the more powerful the act of witnessing becomes. The images that rank highest should carry the electricity of "I cannot believe I caught that" — the sense that the universe briefly arranged itself into something extraordinary and one person happened to have a camera.

### 3. Generosity

The third quality is generosity — the spirit in which the image is shared.

This is the most subtle dimension, and in some ways the most important, because it speaks not to what is in the image but to the relationship between the person who took it and the person who sees it. A generous image is one that feels like a gift. It says: something happened in my ordinary life, in my ordinary home, and it delighted me so much that I wanted you to see it too. There is no self-promotion in it. There is no brand. There is no attempt to impress. There is only the impulse to share a small, surprising, unremarkable-to-anyone-else moment because the sharing itself is the point.

You can feel generosity in the absence of curation. The photographer did not wait for better lighting. They did not clean the background. They did not take forty shots and select the best one. They took the photo and shared it, and the roughness of that pipeline is itself a form of honesty. The image says: this is not a performance, this is a dispatch. I saw this and I thought of you — "you" being not a specific person but the vast, anonymous community of people who also find joy in the small absurdities of living with cats.

Generous images also tend to carry a sense of humor, or tenderness, or both. They are not trying to be art. They are trying to communicate a feeling: Can you believe he sleeps like this? She sat in the grocery bag for forty-five minutes. He has been staring at this wall since Tuesday. The function must recognize this quality because it is the connective tissue of witnessing. Spontaneity tells us the moment was real. Impermanence tells us it was fleeting. Generosity tells us it was worth sharing — and that the sharing was an act of kindness, not commerce.

## The Philosophy Beneath

Taken together, these three qualities — spontaneity, impermanence, and generosity — describe a way of seeing. They privilege attention over intention, luck over skill, and connection over performance. A photograph that ranks high on all three dimensions is not necessarily a good photograph by any technical standard. It may be blurry, poorly lit, and badly framed. But it will feel alive in a way that a technically perfect image often does not, because it will carry the unmistakable evidence of a real person in a real moment who chose to share what they saw.

This is what rank-cats-by-witnessing is ultimately measuring: not the quality of the photograph, but the quality of the seeing. The best images are the ones where you can feel the presence of the person behind the camera — their surprise, their delight, their quiet sense of luck at having been in exactly the right place at exactly the right time. The function asks, of every image: was this found or made? Was this discovered or manufactured? Was this witnessed or produced? And then it lifts the witnessed things to the top, where they belong.
